    "transcript": " From The New York Times, this is The Daily. I'm Natalie Ketrowa. In the ongoing trade war between the US and China, the biggest sticking point is a handful of metals that are extremely rare, essential to the US, and almost entirely under the control of China. The problem is, China has now cut off America's access to those metals, threatening the US industry and its military. Today, my colleague Keith Bradshaw explains how the US became so dependent on China for these metals in the first place, and just how hard it'll be to live without them. It's Tuesday, June 10th. Keith, it is lovely to see you again. It's great to be back, thank you. So it's Monday evening, delegations for the US and China met in London today to try to hash out a deal to deescalate this trade war. There's going to be another set of meetings on Tuesday. And at the heart of these negotiations, we know are these rare earth metals, China essentially band shipments of them to the US and early April, and that's caused a lot of problems. You, Keith, have been covering this industry from inside of China for many, many years, which I mean, respect. But if you would ask me a year ago whether we'd be doing an entire daily episode on this, I might not have believed you. So tell me about this rare earth's business. Well, first, just as an overview, the rare earth's industry has it all. It's got murderous gangsters, acid pits, dirt bikes, American defense contractors, electric cars, clean energy, possibly mass layoffs in the US economy. You name it, this industry's got it. Wow. You had me a dirt bikes, Keith. The dirt bikes we're going to get to. First, what are these rare earths? These are elements near the bottom of the periodic table that everybody saw on their classroom walls, even if they didn't pay attention to them. And some of these rare earths really aren't that rare. You've got lanthanum, which is used at oil refineries to separate the oil into the gasoline and the diesel and the jet fuel and so forth. You've got cerium, which is used for polishing glass for your camera lenses. But there are seven rare earth elements that are considerably less common. China completely dominates the world's supply of them. It mines most of them in processes, almost 100% of them. Those seven are dysprozium, gadolinium, lutecium, samarium, scandium, terbium, and itrium. Okay. Some of us may have never heard of scandium before. But it sounds like these are both very rare and very important. What do they go into? Give me a sense here of why we should care about these things. These elements are used in many products that have changed our lives. They're in aircraft parts. They're in lasers. They are in the contrast agent that's used when you go to the hospital for medical imaging. And the most important and fastest growing uses are for very powerful magnets. You can make a rare earth magnet that is 15 times as strong as an old-fashioned steel magnet. Take a car, for example. If you went back quite a few years, you had to move the car seat back and forth manually. These days, a single luxury car seat may have 12 separate motors to do all kinds of little adjustments to that seat. Your fire adjustment, your lower back adjustment, the tilt of the back of the seat. All these things, these days, have little electric motors, and each of those has a rare earth magnet. And it's not just limited to cars. For example, the seventh of these rare earth elements, samarium, has lots of military applications because it can stay strongly magnetic, even at temperatures that will melt lead. And as a result, samarium magnets, you find 50 pounds of them in an F-35 stealth jet. You find them in missiles. You find them in drones. You find them in smart bombs. Really, these rare earths now are critical both to the economy and to national security. Okay. So, I want to understand, Keith, how we got to a situation where China has near total control over the supply of these metals and magnets that are so important, where we're at their win. How did this happen? What's particularly striking is that it was the United States and a little bit Japan that invented these amazing magnet technologies using rare earths. They really came out of General Motors research in the 1980s. And in the 1990s, the US was making these magnets in Indiana and it was mining much of the world's rare earths for those magnets right in the United States at Mountain Pass, California, which is close to the California Nevada border. It's out in the desert up in there. Beautiful place. Anyway, that mine in Mountain Pass was the world's largest and even main mine for producing rare earths for decades. In fact, the Europium, a different rare earth element, from that mine put the color red in the early color televisions. But in 1998, that mine was forced to close. It stopped production. Why did it stop production? It turned out that it had a pipeline that leaked traces of heavy metals and a faint radioactive residue in a desert area, including where there were a few rare tortoises. And the cost of the cleanup and of improving the environmental compliance was more than the owners of the mine could afford, so the mine shut down. And meanwhile, China had been ramping up its own rare earth production through the 1980s, through the 1990s, doing it very cheaply without a lot of environmental compliance at all. And many big businesses were welcoming China's decision to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. And so the feeling was that this was the beginning of a closer economic integration with China. Right, this is the heyday of free trade orthodoxy. I mean, this is the moment for optimism around this. And I'd imagine that the US closing its only mine for rare earths, seeding the field to China makes for a pretty big business opportunity over there for businesses that want to get into this. That's exactly right. So a lot of people saw a chance to make money and set up their own mines and processing facilities, both legal businesses and also organized crime. Tell me about that Keith, why organized crime? These rare earths are not that hard to mine, doesn't take lots of big sophisticated equipment. And they were being mined in the case of the best or deposits of all in a poor province in South Central China with a reputation for corruption. Let me tell you how they mine them. You get a guy with a dirt bike. He carries this is where the dirt bikes come in. That's exactly right. You get a guy with a dirt bike and it drives up the side of a pine covered red clay hill. Digs a small hole in the dirt dumps in a sack of cream colored powder. It's ammonium sulfate, in less concentrated versions, it's actually a fertilizer. And then he dumps a bunch of water in it and as it percolates down through the inside of the hill, it dissolves a lot of the rare earths with it. And it begins coming out the bottom of the hill just because water eventually comes out somewhere. It's just like making coffee. Yes, wow. I never heard that explanation before. That is exactly what it's doing. The hill is like coffee grounds. The coffee is coming out the bottom of the hill into a pit you dig in the clay and you dump in a lot of oxalic acid into the slurry and that causes the rare earths to settle out as faintly pink crystals on the bottom of the clay pit. So then you dump out all the remaining acid and other liquid and contaminants into the creek, let the faintly pink crystals dry. Then from there, after the different rare earths are separated from each other, they're taken to the magnet factories in Ganjo and turned into these extraordinarily powerful magnets. But the first stages of that process easily lend themselves to criminal activity. Because it's straightforward to do this is what you're saying. It's very straightforward. It's called bucket chemistry. It doesn't take a lot of resources to do it. All it really takes is a corrupt local politician willing to look the other way as you start digging holes in public lands and dumping chemicals in them and pumping out what comes out of the bottom of the hillside. I have to say it really reminds me of when I saw a fentanyl being made when I was reporting in Mexico, just as an aside, there's something similar about the bucket chemistry of it all. It's a good comparison because some of these rare earths sell for hundreds of dollars per kilogram. So it's also lucrative. Yes. There's a lot of money in it. When I first started covering this industry in 2009, the buyers used to be taken in the trunks of cars so that they wouldn't know where they were going to a secret warehouse in Guangzhou. And then they climb out of the trunk and they'd be shown the various merchandise. So this was a very dubious industry. A Wild West. It sounds like my question is were American companies getting their medals from these kind of rogue producers? What's remarkable is that companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen. They depended on these very dubious rare earth value chains, but nobody was clear on where their rare earths were coming from. How much was from legal mines? How much was from the illegal mines? At the same time, demand for these rare earths was exploding as companies found more and more uses for them. So by 2004, China had acquired an almost complete grip on the entire supply chain for rare earths and rare earth magnets. But then in 2010, China shocked the world. Our top story, several tiny uninhabited islands in the East China Sea are at the heart of an escalating dispute between China and Japan. China and Japan were arguing over who owned a small group of uninhabited islands north of Taiwan. Beijing's countermeasures took aim at the heart of the Japanese economy. And China suddenly imposed a total embargo on any shipments of rare earths to Japan, which at the time really played the central role in making the magnets and many other technologies. In the stream, Minister Ohatta said it's clear Japan is ill-prepared to lose its supply of rare earth medals. In these factories, we're producing a lot of the basic industrial materials that in turn then went to the United States, Europe, South Korea, and elsewhere. Frankly, this story is about the rare earth exports being held up. Is it kind of leverage that I thought went out with the Cold War 20 years ago. And the embargo lasted for two months. But this incident, which really shook Japan and to some extent the US, resulted in both countries taking actions on rare earths, although what Japan did would prove much more effective than the American response. We'll be right back. Let's talk about Japan's response. What does Japan do after this embargo? For Japan, the embargo was so traumatic that the government and the companies said never again. The companies began pouring money into building stockpiles of these rare earths. And the government in cooperation with one of the big trading companies of Japan began providing the financing for a big mine to be dug in Australia and for mineral processing then to be done in Malaysia. So those moves reduced considerably Japan's dependence on China. Interesting. So Japan decided to try to become self-sufficient because of all this. What did the US do? In the United States, there was a lot of talk about taking action, about ending American dependence on Chinese rare earths. The bottom line is this. China is cornering the market on rare earth materials and we, the United States, are falling behind. Some members of Congress were expressing a lot of concern about it in late 2010. Now the fact is that they're called rare earth for reason. They are rare. Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State then, expressed strong concern. The world as a whole needs to find new sources which we will be pursuing. And investors started to see rare earths as an attractive possibility. This is Mount Pass mine. It's over 50 years ago. Currently, getting ready to go back into operation. At the Mount Pass mine in California, a billion dollars were spent on very elaborate environmental precautions. There were points in our history that we are not proud of. We have learned from those issues that we have redesigned our processes to make sure that mine finally reopened in 2014. But something else was happening at the same time. Following out in rare earth equities. China released a flood of additional rare earths into world markets. And that flood of rare earths pushed the prices way down. It wasn't possible for the Mount and Pass mine to earn enough money selling rare earths at these low prices to pay back its debts. And so the mine ended up closing again the next year in 2015 and went bankrupt. But was that not an issue in Japan? This influx of cheap metals from China? It was an issue and the Japanese companies were willing to pay a little more to get production that they knew wouldn't be interrupted from Australia. And the Japanese corporate and governmental alliance was willing to keep lending money to make sure that the Australians didn't go out of business. Basically what we're talking about here is industrial policy, right? Japan showed a willingness to prop up an industry that may not be profitable but is seen as critical to national interests. That's exactly right. The United States tried to do the same. But after a few years as sometimes happens, people began to lose interest. There wasn't the same enthusiasm for maintaining a separate supply chain from China. So the US sort of lost track of this issue and then when China suddenly halted supplies in April 4th, that failure to keep track of it came back to haunt the United States. Right. Here we are today facing another situation in which China is restricting the export of rare earths, putting the US and a lot of countries in a really difficult position. So what does the US do now? What are the steps the administration has taken? We've seen considerable pressure by the United States on China to allow an immediate resumption of rare earth exports. The American and European car makers need these rare earths and China has begun allowing some of them out as the US has put on the pressure. Now what kind of pressure are we talking about? The US has stopped selling jet engines to the commercial aircraft that China is starting to build in competition with Boeing. The United States has also halted the delivery of some computer chip design equipment to China. And the US briefly said that it would stop issuing many visas to Chinese students to put pressure on China to get more of these rare earths. I had no idea that the potential limitations on Chinese students coming to the US were part of this negotiation. Almost entirely actually. Keith, what do you think of this pressure campaign? How likely is it to succeed? Well, it has been a way to show China that the US is very serious about the rare earths issue and that the US also has cards to play, that the two countries need each other in many ways. And so the US effort has helped lead to the talks now underway in London. The real question is what kind of an agreement can be reached going forward. So for that, it's likely we're going to see China resuming commercial supplies of rare earths to the west. The difficulty, however, is that China may not allow enough rare earths to be exported for people to build stockpiles so that they know the next time China cuts off supplies, they won't run out immediately. So we'll likely see continued limits on the volumes even for commercial and then for national security uses, for military uses, it may be extremely difficult to persuade China to resume shipments of Samarium, which are needed for all of these fighter jets, missiles and so forth, and are needed not just by the United States, but for weapons deliveries to places like Ukraine or Israel or Taiwan. So this doesn't just make the US vulnerable. It actually has these ripple effects where there's all these other countries that rely on the US for weapons that may also be squeezed because of this. Absolutely. And it sounds like even in the best case scenario for the US, where the pressure campaign works and China starts letting these metals back in, even in that scenario, the US has not addressed the longer term issue here. Like that wouldn't do anything to wean the US off of China for these rare earths. That's right. A long term solution requires, first of all, producing these kinds of rare earths in the United States, producing the magnets that come from these kinds of rare earths in the United States. And then making sure that new production doesn't just close down again in a couple of years as happened the last time around. So how do you keep that production going? Well, first of all, American companies need to be willing to sign very long term contracts for magnets and so forth from suppliers that are not in China, even if that means agreeing in the long term to pay a somewhat higher price. Which seems difficult. Yes. But there's another way you can force them to buy American magnets. And that would be to put lasting high tariffs on imports of rare earths and rare earth magnets from China to discourage customers in the United States from choosing Chinese suppliers and to encourage them to buy American products instead. So just stepping back here. It seems like one way you could look at this is that Trump kind of did the worst thing possible for the American manufacturers that he says he's trying to help. Which is that he essentially provoked China to hit them right at their Achilles heel where they're most vulnerable, which is their reliance on China for these extremely rare and important metals. That's one of the two theories is that the administration has triggered a crisis for American manufacturing. And to take it farther that some American manufacturers might conclude that it's safer to start making their entire brake motors or steering motors or other systems in China just to make sure that those motors can get enough magnets. In fact, that's what happened after the 2010 crisis. A lot of companies did move, for example, magnet manufacturing into China because they said, well, boy, if I can't get the rare earth out of China, then I better be making my magnets in China. Because in the 2010 crisis, China did not restrict the export of magnets. It just restricted the raw materials. Now it's taking the second step, restricting rare earths and magnets. So then some companies are beginning to say, well, maybe we need to make the whole motors in China. That's one theory. The other theory, however, is that China might have bungled this in a different way. Which is that American companies, and for that matter, European companies and Japanese companies might say, we can no longer really trust China with a big role in our supply chains. And we need to move a lot of production out of China. It is possible that what we'll see is companies, for example, automakers might say, why are we buying all of our starters and so many of our fuel injection systems and so forth from China? If on any day, because of a geopolitical dispute, they might cut us off and shut down all our factories. And so you might see American companies and Japanese companies and European companies say, OK, that's the last straw. And we're going to move our purchasing contracts to Mexico and Vietnam and India and places like that. Yeah, it's funny. Another way you could see this is that the episode itself highlights just how dependent we are on Chinese imports and how vulnerable that makes us. And that is sort of a central tenet of Trump's theory of the US relationship with China. The question is, again, can you go the Japan route in the United States? Can you really design some policies here that prioritize self-sufficiency, national security over the profitability of a potential mine, which seems like is difficult in the context where China dominates? It's difficult in the United States because the history has been a reluctance to lend a lot of government money to a specific project like this mine. And then also because there's been quite a bit of hostility to tariffs. Right. Industrial policy is not something that America has done particularly well. No, and this is proving it all over again. In fact, you could make a case. There are few worse examples of misplaced industrial policy than how America has handled its rarest dependence. Keith? Thanks for coming on the show. Really good to talk to you, Natalie, always my pleasure. We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today. Protests over deportation roundups continued for a fourth day in Los Angeles and spread to other cities as tensions rose over the Trump administration's aggressive response to the demonstrations. On Monday, the Pentagon ordered an extra 2,000 National Guard troops to be sent to LA, double the number already on the ground, and also mobilized a battalion of 700 Marines to the city. Meanwhile, the feud between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom intensified. Kanye sued the Trump administration to stop the deployment of National Guard troops, arguing that it violated the Constitution. Newsom told the Times that deployment was, quote, a provocation and said many of the 2,000 soldiers already dispatched to the city were not being put to work. And after the president's borders are, Tom Homan suggested the administration was prepared to arrest Newsom if he interfered with immigration enforcement, Newsom hit back. Come after me, arrest me. Let's just get it over with. Tough guy. And US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all 17 members of a committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on immunization. The panel wields enormous influence, and its recommendations determine vaccine coverage for insurance companies and government programs like Medicaid. These decisions directly contradicts a promise he made during his confirmation hearings, when he said he would not alter the committee. Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson, Alex Stern, and Stella Tan. It was edited by Lisa Chao and Chris Haxel, contains original music by Diane Wong and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly. That's it for the Daily. I'm Natalie Kietrowf. See you tomorrow.",

    "transcript": " From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants by quickly labeling them as gang members and foreign enemies, boarding them on planes to El Salvador, and side-stepping their rights to a court hearing where anyone might be able to scrutinize the claims made against them. As a result, very little has been known about who these men are or how they were targeted by immigration officials. Until now. Today, my colleague Julie Turquoise explains who was actually on those planes and the secretive process that led to their deportations. It's Wednesday, April 23rd. So Julie, as a lot of our listeners know, there's been one story that has really dominated the news cycle recently. It's been the case of this man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He was the Salvadoran man who was on one of the planes that deported hundreds of people from the United States to El Salvador to these prisons. But you've been focused on something else. You have focused on the other 200-plus people who are on those planes, as well as dozens of people around the country who have been rounded up by immigration authorities. So can you just tell us what specifically have you been trying to look into? Sure. Myself and a large team of reporters and researchers at the times really wanted to understand who were the people sent to El Salvador and how they were identified. These are people who weren't just deported. They have also been incarcerated in a foreign country in a maximum security prison built for terrorists. And the Trump administration has made all kinds of claims about these individuals saying that they are members of this Venezuelan gang. But we've found, for example, in the case of Abrego Garcia, is that what the government is saying about the individuals that it is sending to El Salvador for incarceration doesn't always have a lot of evidence behind it. And so it was important to kind of dig into who these people are. And if they are, in fact, members of a gang as the Trump administration says they are, because if that is not true, it opens up all kinds of questions about who else could be identified with very little evidence as a member of a gang and sent to a prison in a foreign country for a year or years to come. So you mentioned gang affiliations. That was one of the things on the government's agenda in terms of why targeted these people. Can you just talk about that a little bit more? Remind us what did the government say specifically in its accusations against some of these people? So right around the time that the Trump administration is sending these men to El Salvador, the administration's borders are, Tom Homan comes out and says these individuals are all members of the Threnderragua. Now the Threnderragua is this Venezuelan gang that has morphed into a transnational criminal organization, but into a recently was not really considered to be a deal in the United States. And then earlier this year, the Trump administration declares the Threnderragua to be a foreign terrorist organization that is working with the Venezuelan government. And not only that, but the administration says that this gang in collaboration with the Venezuelan government is perpetrating invasion of the United States. Wow. Now this is really debatable because we don't have evidence that this group has arrived in the United States in very large numbers. And whatever connection they might have with the Venezuelan government is not proven. But what the Trump administration is doing is claiming that there is an invasion so that I can invoke this 18th century law called the Alien Enemies Act that allows the Trump administration to swiftly deport individuals who are part of a nation that has invaded the United States or is it war with the United States? Swiftly deport meaning like no due process, no time in court. Correct. Now the Supreme Court after the initial flights of 238 men went to El Salvador, said that no going forward the Trump administration must allow some kind of due process to these men. It must notify these men that they are being targeted. They've been identified as alien enemies and it must allow them an opportunity to fight that claim before they're deported. And then on Friday, the Trump administration attempted to continue to send more individuals to El Salvador using the Alien Enemies Act and the Supreme Court weighed in again and halted this effort and said no at this point this is not permitted. And just to be clear, one of the things that the Supreme Court seems to want to preserve here is the right of these men to defend themselves, maybe say, hey, I'm not a gang member, present some evidence for their defense. Because without that, then we don't know if mistakes are made, we don't know if the administration was correct in the evidence, it presents. And it seems like you actually were the one digging into who these people were. Tell us about what you actually found when you started to do that reporting. To be very clear, the Trump administration is being extremely secretive about who has been sent to El Salvador and what evidence it has against them. The US government and the Salvadoran government have refused to even release a list of who is currently incarcerated in El Salvador. But my colleague, Ahmed Alea Sees was able to obtain the internal list. These names were initially reported by CBS. And we ran them through databases. So we were doing background checks in Chile, in Colombia, in Peru. Now I should know that it's very difficult to find criminal records from all over the world. So international public database that we could just search and use to excavate information. So is it possible that we missed something, of course, but a team of us reporters and researchers dedicated weeks to understanding the criminal backgrounds of these individuals. Right. We were only able to find serious criminal accusations or convictions for 32 of them. What kind of serious crimes are we talking about? So for example, we found one person with a murder conviction in Venezuela. We found another individual who is accused of kidnapping and drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in Chile. Someone who authorities in Chile do believe is a member of Trinidad Ragua. We found others who had been accused of being involved in an attack in Chicago. And so we found some folks with some pretty serious criminal accusations or convictions. Okay. So obviously those are very violent offenses. Did you find any other types of criminal activity? Absolutely. We found about two dozen people who had these much lower level offenses, right, speeding in a school zone, trespassing, driving without proper registration. But the vast majority of the people did not seem to have a criminal record beyond sometimes infractions related to their immigration cases. So we're talking about criminal records here. What about the accusation that these men are, in fact, TDA are gang affiliated? Well, that is a good question because it's important to point out that while in a minority, we'll in a handful of cases, for example, this individual in Chile, we did find some evidence that maybe authorities believe their Trinidad Ragua. For the vast majority of these people, we found no evidence that they have any connection to this violent, Venezuelan game. But as we spoke to families of many of the men on those planes, we started to find a few common traits that appear to have led them to be targets for deportation. One person who I spent a lot of time speaking with his family is Arturo Suarez. Arturo left Venezuela in 2016. He had participated in anti-government protests in 2014, sort of calling for change in Venezuela and eventually decided because of the political situation, because of the economic situation, to move to Colombia, then he moved to Chile and Chile he meets his wife, another Venezuelan, a woman named Natalie. Hello, all the Natalie. I spoke with Natalie this month. She told me a little bit about him. He's been a little more than 10 years dedicated to music. He in Chile worked in installing these sort of large-scale refrigerators, but his real passion and what people really know him for, what his friends, his family know him for is his music. And as a part of his sort of growing music career, he had a lot of tattoos. Some of them are sort of aspirational, inspirational. One of them is this hummingbird on his neck. And another is a phrase that his family sort of describes as emblematic of his outlook and it says the future is bright. Money is tight and eventually Natalie gets pregnant and they decide that Arturo is going to go to the United States and the idea is that he's going to go to the United States. You know, in the worst-case scenario, I earning dollars to sort of assist my growing family. Maybe my wife comes to join me. Maybe I go back to Chile. In the best-case scenario, I meet all kinds of amazing producers and you know, my career really takes off in the US where there's really just an opportunity to become like a global superstar as opposed to Chile where you're sort of relegated to a much smaller stage. So how does he eventually get into the US? So he enters the country in September of 2024. He enters using this application called CBP1. This is this Biden era application that allowed people and many, even as well as to advantage of this, to present themselves at the US border and essentially ask for the opportunity to come in and make a case that they should be able to stay. And actually, once Arturo gets into the country, he's starting to make some money and he and Natalie decide that eventually he's going to save up and he's going to go back to Chile but he never gets the opportunity to make that trip back. Why would happens? So on February 8th, he arrives at this house in Raleigh to fill a music video and that is where he is apprehended by immigration agents. According to his family, immigration authorities tell him that he's being detained due to his immigration status. He is sent to a detention center in Georgia. He's able to make phone calls. His wife, Natalie, isn't touched with him. But after about a month in this detention facility, Arturo tells his wife, that he actually wants to be deported. He's ready to sort have this nightmare beover and that it's way better to be back in Venezuela or back in Chile than to be in a detention center in the United States. And so on March 14th, he calls her and he tells her that he will probably be deported the next day. He says he will be deported to Venezuela. I've been told by American authorities that I am being sent back to Venezuela. Natalie tells me that she's just so filled with relief. And he sends a text that night saying, I love you, will soon be together forever. But after that message is sent about a day passes and Arturo is silent. He essentially disappears and Natalie starts to get really nervous. And on March 16th, when Arturo has not showed up in Venezuela, Natalie turns to Google. And on her phone, she types into this little search box, deportations to Venezuela. And what pops up are these photos of Venezuelan men deported and incarcerated in El Salvador. And these are the photos that I think a lot of us saw, right, with men with shaved heads. Their arms behind their back edited some sort of prison complex it looked like. Absolutely. She sees this photo with this sort of sea of men wearing these sort of white prison outfits on the ground sort of hunched over in a sort of identical form. She zooms in, sees the hummingbird tattoo and realizes that one of them is her husband. We'll be right back. So Julie, earlier you said that when you were speaking to families of the men on these planes, like Arturo's, you began to notice traits that they shared that seemed to have made them targets for deportation. Tell me about those traits. So earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security issued an internal guideline called the Alien Enemy Balladation Guide. And this guide gives us a window into how the Trump administration is identifying supposed members of the Tren Der Abois. This guide instructs officials to use a point system to grade suspected members of the gang. Once someone gets eight points, they become a quote validated member of the gang and therefore an alien enemy who can be subject to this kind of deportation. And of course, we know that these folks are not just being deported but also incarcerated. Wait, so okay, so a point system like if you get enough points, the government says you are a gang member. Do I have that right? Correct. That's exactly how it works. Can you just explain that a little bit like how are the points actually assigned and what do you accrue points for? So this document instructs officials to give individuals two points if they are discovered to have lived with a member of the Tren Der Abois, two points for being photographed with a member of the group, two points for using social media to display symbols, unclear what those are of the gang. And most important, the document instructs officials to give four points for having tattoos denoting membership in the Tren Der Abois. And another four points for displaying quote, dress known to indicate allegiance to the gang. And that kind of dress includes high end urban streetwear and it includes wearing sports gear from US sports teams with prominent Venezuelans on them. I mean, it's the strikes me as like not foolproof. I mean, is this point system that is used by law enforcement in this case to identify gang members? Is this typical? Is this unheard of? Can you put this into context for us? So US law enforcement has used tattoos in the past to identify members of a gang. And that is because there are some transnational gangs that have a presence in the United States like MS-13 that use tattoos as identifiers of membership. You know, we've seen these sort of big MS-13 tattoos. The problem is that a member of our team in Venezuela spoke with five different experts on the Tren Der Abois. These are people who have been working with this group for years, police officials, academics, and a journalist who wrote a book about the Tren Der Abois. And all of them say that Tren Der Abois does not use tattoos as a marker of membership. And while there may be many gang members who have tattoos, there are also many young Venezuelan men who have tattoos. And were tattoos one of the common denominators you were finding among these men? We spoke with families and a couple of lawyers for 30 of the men who were sent to El Salvador. And we found that at least 27 of them have tattoos and these tattoos include names of family members, names of girlfriends and wives. And they also include things like crowns, for example, and you know, inspirational messages. And what we found is that even though the Tren Der Abois doesn't use tattoos as a marker of membership, the government has a list of tattoos that it considers to be suspicious. And that includes, for example, that crown tattoo that I mentioned that is also sported by Leonel Messi, the famous soccer star. It also includes the sort of Michael Jordan Jumpman silhouette that of course was popularized by Nike and by the basketball star. So the government appears to have taken this not really very definitive criteria having tattoos or having crown and Jumpman tattoos and combining it with other not very definitive criteria like wearing urban streetwear and used it to identify someone as a quote validated member of this game. Right, because presumably there might be fans of Michael Jordan and Lionel Messi who want tattoos of images that they help to popularize. And those people might not be in gangs and similarly people who wear urban streetwear might not be in gangs. So it sounds like this from everything you have learned, this system of identification really has some kind of questionable flaws to it. Absolutely. And the problem is that the sort of possible misidentification of people as gang members has dire consequences. These men are now in a prison, they have not had a court hearing. They have little or no access to lawyers or their families. And we know that the conditions in this prison that they have been sent to are extremely harsh. This prison was built by the president of El Salvador to be sort of emblematic of his crackdown on terrible criminals in his own country. The head of the Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Nome, has said that these individuals are not being held in the same conditions. But we don't really know that because no one has been given full and free access to the prison. And these folks, unlike when they were in US detention, now that they're in Salvador in prison, these individuals do not have access to a telephone or a messaging app or a way to communicate to the outside world what their lives are like on the inside. Do we have any sense how long they might be there? When these men were initially sent to El Salvador, the president of El Salvador, Naibu Kale, said that they would be in prison there for at least a year. And at the same time, he called that sentence, quote unquote renewable. But what we've seen since is that Kristi Nome, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, has come out and said that she believes these individuals should be held in the prison for the rest of their lives. Julie, I feel like it's totally fair for us to point out that these deportations might have been extremely flawed, that these conditions might be extremely harsh. But I want to note two things. The first is that many Americans voted for President Trump and feel that the immigration system in this country is broken. Even if some people enter this country legally, they are still in some way taking advantage of the country to the detriment of Americans. And the second thing I want to note is that it feels like we're in this moment right now where people can be divided into sort of two camps just to make a really broad generalization. In one group, you have people who are alarmed by this lack of due process who say, listen, maybe these guys should have been deported anyway, but we need to find out by putting them through a system so that we can make sure we're not deporting the wrong people that everybody should have their day in court. And then what we also have is another group of people that feel that it is okay to have collateral damage. In this case, potentially sending innocent men to a terrorist prison in order to overhaul a broken system. And I'm just curious if you are sort of seeing the landscape in that way. Yeah, I think that that is absolutely a fair summary of the situation. And I think that it's really important to point out that what we have seen in the last couple of months is a dramatic decline in people arriving at the US border. This is something that started under the Biden administration because of some of these sort of stricter policies that the administration put in place among other factors. But it has really been sustained and has become very evident under the Trump administration. The messaging that the Trump administration is sending seems to have worked. The thing is, we just don't know how deep the collateral damage will be. We don't know what people are exposed to in this prison in El Salvador. We don't know if they'll get out ever. And what my colleagues and I are learning from new reporting in the past few days is that there are additional people who are no longer showing up in this public database of migrants detained in the US, but who are not on the internal government list of migrants sent to El Salvador. Presumably, the US government knows where they are, but their families don't know where they are. We don't know where they are. They have essentially, for public purposes, been disappeared. Wow. And I think the concern of many people watching this play out is that the shift in policy runs deeper than just sending a couple of hundred people to a foreign prison. And so there's this fundamental question as to whether what we're seeing here is the American people except that they are willing to give up certain rights in order to tackle this problem and feel somehow safer in their own country. Julie, thank you so much. Thank you. We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today. Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a plan to make major cuts to the State Department, calling the government's diplomatic agency, quote, bloated bureaucratic, and behold into radical political ideology. The cuts focus on operations in Washington, but will also affect the work of embassies and consulates overseas, including the elimination of the office of the Undersecretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, which is charged with advancing American values around the world. And the executive producer of 60 minutes, the Tiffany brand of American television journalism, resigned on Tuesday, saying that he was no longer allowed to run the show the way that he always had, and make independent decisions. The producer, Bill Owens, is only the third person to hold his position in the show's 57-year history, and his departure marked a new period of turmoil for CBS News and 60 minutes, which is facing a $10 billion lawsuit from President Trump. Today's episode was produced by Carlos Prieto and Caitlin O'Keefe, with help from Jessica Chung and Will Read. It was edited by Lizzo Balan with help from Maria Byrne and Michael Benoit, contains original music by Pat McCusker, Alicia B. E. Toup, and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood. Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonder Lake. That's it for the Daily. I'm Rachel Abrams. See you tomorrow.",
