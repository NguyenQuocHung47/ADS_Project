        "summary": "- On Monday, church bells rang out across the world to mark the death of Pope Francis at the age of 88.\n- Today, the New York Times looks at the Pope's push to change the church, his bitter clashes with traditionalists, and what his papacy ultimately means to the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. \n- Jason Horowitz, Rome bureau chief, talks about the ultimate legacy of Francis, who is seen as a dividing line in the Roman Catholic Church. \n- He came to power with the hope that he would shake up the church and introduce long-awaited reforms.\n\n- Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who later became Pope Francis, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was raised in a humble family that was present in the Catholic Church\n- While Bergoglio wanted to become a chemist as a teenager, he had an epiphany and decided to dedicate his life to the church instead, becoming a priest later on\n- Bergoglio became a cardinal before becoming the Pope in 2013, which surprised many as Pope Benedict XVI retired, making it unclear where the church was headed next\n- Bergoglio's conservative background influenced his views on the church, which he saw as an important institution in one's life, emphasizing the importance of education and social justice\n\n- The host and his guest discuss the history of Pope Francis and how he became pope unexpectedly and how he changed the Catholic Church by choosing to go to the peripheries and be with the people and stop focusing so much on ourselves, and how this knocked the socks of the cardinals and people in the church.\n- They also discuss the gestures and actions he took in his early days as Pope and how he shocked the world with his untraditional views on gay priests and abortion.\n- The guest remembers watching all of this unfold and thinking something interesting is happening here, but he reserves judgment because it's a very traditional institution. \n- Pope Francis has turned the church upside down and people are wondering if he's going to change things and if it's the beginning of a revolution.  him as a man of the moment with other liberal leaders in politics across the globe at the time.\n\n- Pope Francis is the Pope of mercy.\n- He's the Pope that visits inmates and seems to be on the forefront of all of this. \n\n- But the idea that Francis would change the legislation of the church is extremely concerning for conservatives. \n\n- There is a kind of papal palace intrigue that's going on behind the scenes as sort of the favorite heroes of the traditionalists and the conservatives in the church are ousted from their positions. \n\n- This leads to a much less traditional church that's more open to debate.\n\n- The Catholic church is in a crisis because Pope Francis is under attack from the conservative element of the church\n- These conservatives are using complicated Vatican mechanisms to question Francis' understanding of his own actions\n- They are also accusing him of covering up allegations of child sexual abuse by other priests \n- This is made worse by the fact that these critics have links with conservative politicians like Donald Trump and Steve Bannon who amplify these messages\n\nLỗi Cohere API: status_code: 429, body: {'message': \"You are using a Trial key, which is limited to 5 API calls / minute.
