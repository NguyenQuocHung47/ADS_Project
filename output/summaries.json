        "summary": "- Pope Francis pushed to change the church during his papacy from 2013 until his death this week at age 88\n- He led the church in a new direction that polarized its 1.\n\n- Jorge Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina with humble roots and middle class status \n\n- He felt called to the Roman Catholic faith at a young age and decided to become a priest, later becoming a Cardinal before being elected as Pope\n\n- Pope Francis is viewed as a change agent, especially with his leftist views, empathy for the poor, and dedication to social justice \nDespite criticism from some, Bergoglio's background and upbringing greatly influenced his religious beliefs and approach to the church.\n\n- Pope Francis has made a point of taking public transportation as an example to his followers that he doesn't think he's better than them.\n- In 2013 Benedict XVI stepped down as Pope and was replaced by Francis, marking the first time a Pope had retired in nearly 300 years.\n- Before the conclave (the election ritual of the Catholic Church) begins, Cardinals can give speeches about what they think is important for the church. \n- Francis gave a speech telling the church they should go to the peripheries (or in other words, go to where the people are). \n- This was interpreted as him wanting priests to literally leave the church and go out on the streets to talk to people. \n- Many were impressed by this speech, and so when the cardinals went into the conclave they chose Francis to lead them.\n\n- When Pope Francis was elected, he was the first Pope to take the name Francis, after a 13th-century saint known for his humility and vows of poverty.\n- He chose to use simpler gestures and language in his address to the masses, which was less formal than traditional Popes. \n- He shocked many with his response to a question about gay priests, saying, \"Who am I to judge?\" \n- This contrasted with the traditional role of the Pope as the primary judge in such matters. \n- Pope Francis' statements led to discussions about whether he would implement significant changes in the Catholic Church. \n- Some hoped he would change traditional doctrines, such as those prohibiting divorced, married persons from receiving communion and prohibiting women from becoming priests. \n- Many people attributed to him the label of a revolutionary in an unrevolutionary institution. \n- However, the implications of his actions and statements remain a topic of debate and discussion. \n- This podcast episode explores these topics and the impact of Pope Francis since his election in 2013.\n\n- Pope Francis is the Pope of mercy: he cares about climate change, visits inmates, and is a strong advocate for immigrants\n- He is recognized worldwide for his efforts, and named Person of the Year by Time magazine\n- Pope Francis triggered a backlash among conservatives within the Catholic Church, as he started changing key doctrines of the church\n\n- A traditionalist house cleaning is currently taking place within the church, with Burke being moved to a lesser position.\n- The Congregation of Bishops is responsible for selecting the next generation of bishops, which is a significant process that impacts the clergy and bishops of the next generation. \n- These new bishops will be more open to debate, less traditional, and more pastoral in their guidance, which is a significant shift from previous doctrine. \n- Some within the church are threatened by this change and are trying to prevent it by challenging the pope, which is unusual behavior for a cardinal. \n- Francis, however, is politically savvy and ignores them, knowing that he is wildly popular with regular Catholics around the world. \n- Instead of engaging with his critics, he ignores them, knowing that they are a small but noisy group within the Vatican who are afraid of his global popularity and his vision for the church.\n\n- Pope Francis is criticized due to his opposition to populism and nationalism\n- These ideologies are often tied to conservative American churches that have a large influence\n- There are groups within the Vatican that oppose Pope Francis due to his beliefs\n- These groups accuse the Pope of knowing about child sexual abuse and hiding it\n- Pope Francis remains unconcerned about the opposition against him since throughout history, there have been many schisms within the church\n\n- Jason Horowitz explains the Catholic church is much bigger than Europe and the US and the future of the church lies in Africa and Asia, where many of the Catholics are conservative and traditional\n- He thinks Pope Francis understands the church will lose people if it makes big changes, like allowing women to become priests \n- Horowitz says initial symbolic changes made by Pope Francis excited progressives, but they are slowly realizing he may not make the sweeping changes they desire, and the changes he makes upset both progressives and conservatives because they are not enough to satisfy either side.\n\n- Jason Horowitz, Vatican correspondent for The New York Times, discusses the complexities of Pope Francis' papacy as he opens the church while not changing the rules to accommodate progressive Catholics, largely in the Americas and Europe.\n- Horowitz discusses Francis' apparent desire to keep the church unified and relevant to as many Catholics as possible, while not allowing the church to be dealt breakers over issues that may be progressives' deal breakers.\n- Horowitz notes that Francis has little patience for those he view as ideologically or politically motivated in their opposition to his agenda, especially if they display what the pope sees as clericalism, or an attitude that priests are superior to their flocks.\n\n- Jorge Bergoglio, known as Pope Francis, is considered a pope that did not fulfill the expectations of either the progressive or conservative wings of the Catholic Church.\n- While he didn't revolutionize the church, he did change the priorities and ideas of what the church is here for, focusing on bringing the faith closer to the people and reminding them of the reasons behind religious institutions. \n- He believes the church became distracted by its focus on dress codes, prayers, and other rituals, forgetting its true purpose. \n- Although difficult to implement changes in a large institution with a bureaucracy that resists change, Francis still managed to make an impact by opening debates and influencing future decisions through the people he appointed, who will more likely support his ideas in the future.\n\n- Jason Horowitz, Vatican reporter for The New York Times, talks about the legacy of Pope Francis on the day he is laid to rest and the process of electing his successor.\n- Harvard has sued the Trump administration, arguing that the school's first amendment rights were violated by the White House.\n- The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 972 points, due to concerns about Trump's tariffs and his attacks on the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\n- The episode ends with a special thanks to Emma Bobola, besides the regular team members acknowledgment\n- The Daily is hosted by Michael Barbaro and is a podcast that provides listeners with a 30 minute summary of the latest news, five days a week. \n- If you want to listen to the episode mentioned, it is titled \"The Daily: 793, Abortion, America's Economic Future, and More.",
