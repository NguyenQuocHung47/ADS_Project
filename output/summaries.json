        "summary": "- Pope Francis died on Sunday at the age of 88; Thousands of mourners have gathered at the Vatican to pay their respects and churches around the world rang bells to commemorate his death\n- Jason Horowitz and Rome Birocheev describe the mournful atmosphere in St.\n\n- Jorge Bergoglio, now Pope Francis, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina with humble middle-class background \n- His grandmother, who he was close to, was an Italian immigrant which made him open his eyes to people's efforts to make it\n- He wanted to become a chemist, but had teachers with communist politics which gave him a bottom-up view of the world \n- He felt a calling to the church as a teenager and decided to become a priest \n- He became a Jesuit priest and later on became the Cardinal of Buenos Aires\n- Stories spread about him being a bit different, making him a significant figure within the church\n\n- Pope Francis has made an effort to travel using public transportation as a way to connect with the flock of the church.\n- Having been named pope in 2013, he was the first non-European pope in nearly 2000 years.\n- Before he was elected, he gave a speech in which he advocated for the church to get out to the peripheries and away from being self-referential. \n- He was elected shortly after giving this speech.\n\n- When Pope Francis was elected, he was the first Pope to take the name Francis, after a 13th-century saint known for his humility and vows of poverty.\n- He chose to use gestures to signal his different priorities, such as being more colloquial in his address to the masses below him. \n- One of the most notable things he said was regarding gay priests, shocking the world by saying, \"Who am I to judge?\"\n- This was in contrast to the past when the Pope was seen as the primary person to judge such matters. \n- People began wondering if real change was coming to the Catholic Church, with Francis effect.\n- He also suggested that married, divorced people could receive communion again, which was previously prohibited.\n- People who had been marginalized by the church for a long time, such as those who wanted married priests or women priests, saw hope in Francis.\n\n- Pope Francis is the Pope of mercy: he cares about climate change, visits inmates, and is a strong advocate for migrants and refugees\n- He is not just a spiritual leader stuck in the Vatican: he's a global player, and his Twitter account at Pontifex is in the top five of the most searched words on the internet\n- While he is highly admired within the church, some conservatives are concerned that he will change the church's doctrine using his popularity: this is also why a backlash is building up\n\n- A traditionalist house cleaning is currently taking place within the Catholic Church, with Burke being removed from his position.\n- The Congregation of Bishops selects the next generation of bishops, meaning that the clergy and bishops who will lead the church in the future will be less traditional, more open to debate, and more pastoral. \n- This has upset some within the church, who feel that Pope Francis' actions are threatening their old way of thinking. \n- They have challenged the Pope's authority, which is unusual, given that the Pope is usually considered to be the final authority within the church. \n- However, Francis has ignored them so far, likely because he is wildly popular with regular Catholics and sees himself as more of a caring and pastoral figure who does not want to get into complicated theological arguments with a conservative opposition group within the church.\n\n- Pope Francis is criticized due to his progressive views and is opposed by many conservative Catholics.\n- These conservatives have accused the Pope of being a heretic and having a conspiracy of silence about child sexual abuse.\n- Pope Francis remains unconcerned about the criticism and seems to dare his opponents to leave the church. \n- He believes that this controversy is a distraction from the church's true mission.\n\n- Jason Horowitz clarifies how Pope Francis's actions satisfy the appetite for change among progressives who want big sweeping changes around several issues within the church. \n- Although it initially seemed like Pope Francis was going to make huge changes, Horowitz explains how he simply cracked open doors that he never actually closed. \n- Progressives within the Catholic church are becoming disappointed as they realize that he is not going to change anything regarding hot button topics. \n- Horowitz speculates that Pope Francis did not want to take the church someplace it wasn't ready to go and potentially lose people, especially in Africa and Asia, where the church's future lies. \n- He believes that Pope Francis was redirecting the ship, but nowhere as ambitious as progressives hoped.\n\n- Jason Horowitz, Vatican correspondent for The New York Times, discusses the complexities of Pope Francis' papacy as he opens the church while not changing the rules to accommodate progressive views on homosexuality and other issues, primarily to keep the church unified and not fractured.\n- Horowitz presents Francis as wanting to keep the church relevant among the fastest-growing Catholic populations and also wanting to include European and American Catholics, who he views as increasingly alienated from the church.\n- Horowitz notes that Francis is largely against ideological, political, and clerical power dynamics and motivations that he sees as threatening the unity and relevance of his mission.\n\n- The Catholic Church is 1.3 billion people strong and struggling to adapt to changing times.\n- Many progressive Catholics thought Pope Francis was going to be a revolutionary pope who would change many rules they disagree with. \n\nHe didn't do that, and many conservatives feel suspicious of him. \n\nNeither side's great expectations for Francis were fulfilled, but that doesn't mean he didn't make important changes to the Church's priorities and messaging. \n\nHe focused the Church's efforts on being more welcoming to everyday people and less rigid about rules and traditions. \n\nHe also made many new appointments to high-ranking Church positions, who tend to see the Church the way he does, thus setting the stage for future changes. \n\nTherefore, despite his lack of radical changes, Francis still managed to make an important impact on the Catholic Church.\n\n- Jason Horowitz, Vatican reporter for The New York Times, recalls the legacy of Pope Francis, whose reforms opened the church to the world while also addressing its scandals.\n- Horowitz talks about the upcoming conclave to elect the next pope, and why Francis chose to be buried in an unmarked tomb outside the Vatican.\n- Meanwhile, Harvard has sued the Trump administration over its attempt to control what the university can teach and who it can hire.\n- The lawsuit comes after the White House froze billions of dollars in funds to Harvard after the university refused to comply with Trump's demands.\n\n- The episode ends with a special thanks to Emma Bobola, besides the regular team members recapitulated at the start of the show.\n- The show's theme music was created by Wonderly, fact-checking was done by Susan Lee, editing was completed by Maria Byrne, and engineering was handled by Chris Wood.\n- Alicia but YouTube, Dan Powell, and Diane Wall created the original music for this episode.",

        "summary": "- The increasingly bitter trade war between the United States and China has resulted in sky-high tariffs on soybeans, with America's soybean farmers appearing to be the most at stake.\n- In the latest episode of The Daily from New York Times, Michael Bavaro speaks with farmer April Hemis, whose family's farm in Iowa has been growing since 1901, about what the tariffs on soybeans mean for her and thousands of American farmers. \n- Hemis explains that around 53% of soybeans exported from the U.S. are shipped to China, due to the country's high demand for the product. \n- She adds that American farmers have had to adapt their practices due to the trade war, as it's been more difficult to plan ahead for the upcoming planting season. \n- The episode offers interesting insights into the global trade dynamics and the impact of political decisions on agricultural industries.\n\n- In the 1980s, American farmers faced a crisis due to high interest rates, low commodity prices, and overproduction.\n- Many farmers went out of business or struggled to keep up with their bank payments.\n- Exports were seen as a solution to this crisis, as China's population was growing fast and they needed to import food.\n- April Hobaica, who was originally planning a career in politics, returned to her family farm during this crisis.\n- Her family struggled during that time, but since then they have benefited from the growth of agricultural exports to Asia, particularly China. \n- Now, soybean production is a key part of their business, and they export about 80% of what they produce. \n- China is an important market for American farmers, as there is a great demand for soy there for animal feed and oil for human consumption. \n- However, the current trade war and tensions between the US and China have led to uncertainty among American farmers about the future of their exports.\n\n- April Hemphill shared her experience in developing relationship and trust from the Chinese authority as a farmer from Iowa who benefited from the new Chinese market demanding for soybeans from the US.\n- It started from President Nixon establishing a relationship in the 70s and it took many years to develop trust.\n- It is important to personally involve in working on and even expanding the relationship between farmers and places like Iowa and China.\n- Hemphill got involved on many local boards or state boards and national boards.\n- Through the Iowa Farm Bureau, she had a chance to visit China and experience how the Chinese farm which helped her realize the limitations in China's farming methods.\n- She also met many public officials who were very cordial but also showed them what they wanted to see like showing a farm of the same size as hers but owned by 400 land owners.\n- This inspired Hemphill to work harder to improve farming in China.\n\n- Michael Taylor is a soybean farmer in Iowa who has met with the Chinese government official in charge of agriculture on multiple occasions. \n- On one occasion, Taylor was invited to a state dinner with this official, where they were served a whole fish and duck, and soju, a strong alcohol, was served. \n- This official later visited Taylor's farm while Taylor was corn harvesting, and they rode together in the combine, an experience that the official found very satisfying. \n- Relationships between the Chinese government and economic community have been increasingly important to Taylor's work.\n\n- In order to expand international trade, it is important to form personal connections with foreign officials and business leaders.\n- While the cost of goods is important to these transactions, building relationships and telling personal stories can foster a stronger, more stable trade environment.\n- Over the past few years, a farmer from Iowa has traveled to China numerous times to meet with Chinese officials and become familiar with the Chinese market and soybean buyers.\n- In recent months, however, the trade relationship between the US and China has been strained by the implementation of high tariffs on goods imported from the other country. \n- The farmer expresses frustration with the instability of current trade relations and the uncertainty of the future of US-Chinese trade.\n\n- Recent instability in the global economy has made it difficult for businesses to plan ahead, and farmers are hoping that governments will work to restore stability and normalize trade relations as soon as possible\n- Farmers are particularly affected by the escalating trade war between the US and China, as Chinese buyers frequently purchase American soybeans\n- Should the trade war continue to escalate, it is likely that soybean prices will decrease significantly since China purchases half of all American exports. \n- In the meantime, farmers are forced to spend significant amounts of money on inputs like seeds, chemicals, and fertilizer, and the rising tariffs make this increasingly difficult.\n\n- While many farmers are against the current trade war with China, given the reliance of agricultural produce exporters on the Chinese market, it is also important to note the inequity of current trade agreements and the resulting loss of jobs and decline in rural economies that have resulted from those inequities.\n- It is important for the President to understand the time and effort that went into creating the relationship between the two countries, and the careful diplomacy required to maintain positive international relations. \n- Farmers are suffering from the current trade war, but also acknowledge the inequity of the current trade deal and are willing to endure the pain that the president predicts will come from his trade policies in order to achieve a more equitable agreement.  who have put so much effort into cultivating positive relationships with Chinese representatives and businesses, and hope to see careful consideration of ongoing diplomatic relationships in the White House' current trade negotiations.\n\n- The US and China are the two largest economies in the world, but they are not talking and that is not good for anyone.\n- President Trump is trying to pressure Ukraine's leader to accept a peace plan that favors Russia, a demand that the Ukrainian leader flatly rejected. \n- The peace talks may break down unless a deal is reached quickly, with US officials ready to blame Ukraine. \n- Today's episode of \"Daily\" also looks at the lack of diversity in outdoor spaces and the history of skateboarding in Vietnam.
