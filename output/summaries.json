        "summary": "Jason Horowitz: Pope Francis was a dividing line in the Roman Catholic church . He says he's not clear what side he's on because he thought of himself as doing something very different, being a pope for not the partisan sides of the church, but for the flock . Horowitz: Francis was born as Jorge Bidagolio and is from Buenos Aires and Argentina. He's not poor, but he's more sort of middle class .\nEven before he was Pope Francis, Francis, he was sort of a master of gestures . He married influences of his childhood, his love of neighborhood, perhaps some of that bottom up teaching with actually being a high ranking church member was to do something as simple as taking the bus, making sure that his commute from home to the church is done on public transportation . Francis is the first Pope ever to take the name Francis, who is known for being extremely humble and vows of poverty .\nTime magazine names Pope Francis as his person of the year. to be different. Time calls the Holy Father a septogenarian superstar. Pope Francis is the Pope of mercy. He's the Pope that visits inmates. He seems very much to be on the forefront of all of this, right? He's not just a spiritual leader stuck in the Vatican, he's a global player. His Twitter account at Pontifex ranks in the top five most searched words .\nThere's a saying in the Vatican that personnel is policy, and one of the first things that Francis starts doing is getting rid of people . The guy who is in charge of the office that protects the doctrine, the congregation for the doctrine of the faith that's called, he gets fired . There's an American cardinal named Raymond Burke, who is the head of what is essentially the Supreme Court of the Vatican, kicked off .\nPope Francis is accused of knowing about child sexual abuse and hiding it . Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganot urges Pope Francis to resign over what he calls a conspiracy of silence about McCarrick . Pope Francis tries to stay above it, but I remember I asked him once on a flight, I said, you know, these people, they can't stand you. And they're talking about breaking apart from the church, he said, then they do it. I'm not scared. If you really want to break away off of this, he's daring. He was saying like he was playing chicken with them. They're probably not going to do it, right?\nFrida Ghitis: In many ways, the pope inspires both the progressive and conservative wings of the Catholic church to think things that don't really come to pass . She says he wants the church to reach a consensus on these things so that it can move together . Ghitis asks: What exactly is his legacy when we think about that concept you brought up at the very beginning of this concept? She says in a sense, he lets down both sides.\nCNN's John Sutter says Pope Francis' pontificate was about reminding people why the church exists . He says it's hard to argue that he didn't make a big change within the Catholic Church . Sutter: The world has lost a very important coast, but it was coming, but he was a brensive fresh air .

Thank you very much. We appreciate it. We appreciate it. We appreciate it. Jason, thank you very much. We appreciate it. We appreciate it.

Jason came to Rome around the same time that Francis became Pope. Jason describes Francis' background and how his background made people on the left and right see him as a change agent.\nBefore Francis became Pope, he was a Jesuit priest and a Cardinal in Buenos Aires. He was a master of gestures. He wants priests to get out of their churches and go to the peripheries and talk to people. Francis is the first Pope to take the name of a Latin saint, Francisco Cibiotto, who is a 13th century saint known for being humble and dedicated to poverty.\nTime magazine names Pope Francis as its person of the year.

Jason is curious how the progressive side of the ledger is seeing Pope Francis. He thinks the symbolic changes that Francis does wet the appetite of liberals in the Catholic church and they start waiting.\nFrancis wants the church to be relevant in the lives of Catholics all around the world, but he also wants to make sure that Catholics in Europe and the United States are still part of the mission. Francis has little patience for what he views as ideological or politically motivated descent. Francis wants to change the church for the benefit of the largest number of Catholics possible in the fastest growing places.\nOn Monday, Harvard sued the Trump administration, arguing that it violated its first amendment rights by seeking to control what the university can teach and who it can hire.

Now he's saying things that shock people in the Catholic Church, like allowing gay priests and same-sex marriage in the church. He's also focusing on issues like climate change and migration.

        "summary": "In the bitter trade war between the U.S. and China, soybean farmers have more at stake than ever. April Hemis, a 65-year-old farmer from Iowa, explains to Michael Bavaro what the tariffs instigated by President Trump now means for her and tens of thousands of American farmers. About 53% over half of the soybeans exported in the US go to China. They are the largest pork producers in the planet.\nIn the 90s and early 2000s, the focus to export soybeans to China ramped up. April visited China for the first time on a market study tour. She was asked to go on a trip to China to support soybeans. April was appointed to the United soybean board by the Secretary of Agribusiness in 2015. April is involved in working on and expanding the relationship between farmers and China.\nMichael met with the president of the Commerce Department for food and natural agriculture products from China. He was there to talk about the high quality soybeans and the personal connection between farmers and the Chinese government. The value of this personal connection is that it increases the value of the crop. The Chinese government sends their officials to visit farmers in the U.S. to check the quality of their crops.\nSoybean farmers from Iowa are worried about the current political situation in the U.S. and China. They have been hit with tariffs of 145% by the US and 125% by China, which directly impacts their business. They need stability in order to plan and grow their businesses. The secretary of agriculture in China retired several years ago, so he doesn't get to chat with farmers.\nSoybean farmers are worried about the impact of the trade war between the U.S. and China. April wants the president to understand the importance of the relationship between the two countries and their farmers. April thanks April for her time on the podcast. April would like to do a podcast from her combine some day. April is not sure if she can do it.\nToday's episode is produced by Jessica Chung, Olivia Nat, Rob Zipko, and Alexandra Lee Young.

She has been promoting soybeans in China for many years. She is showing New York Times the pictures of her farm and her travels.\nIn the late 80s and early 90s, there was a farm crisis in the United States. People couldn't afford to buy land. Commodity prices were high. Many farmers went out of business. Nowadays, farmers are involved in promoting the relationship between Iowa and China. April is involved in local and national boards. She visited China on a market study tour.\nMichael met with the president of the Commerce Department for food and natural agriculture products from China. He was there to talk about the high quality soybeans that he grows. In the fall in Iowa, they host the world food prize. Chinese buyers from the soybean export council come to the farm to see the harvest. Michael was explaining to them how he raises his crops.\nAfter spending a lot of time cultivating the relationships between Iowa farmers and China, especially soybean farmers, I want to know what it's been like to watch over the past few weeks as these historically high tariffs go into place by the US and then China retaliates with a higher tariff. Iowa exports about half of its soybeans to China. The instability of the current trade situation worries Iowa farmers.\nIf China stops buying American soybeans, the price would go down. The relationship between the US and China is important for both farmers and the economy. President Trump is right to worry about a possible trade war between the two countries. He was elected on a pro-trade platform. He understands the pain that a trade war would cause farmers. He has promised to work on it.\nToday on Karaoke, Makabo Boa, Seelmo and Rob Zipko are doing karaoke. In their latest clash, President Trump wants Ukraine's leader to accept a peace plan that heavily favours Russia. US officials have warned Zelensky that the White House may abandon the peace talks in the coming days unless a deal can be reached.",
